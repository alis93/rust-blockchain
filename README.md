A very simple rust project create to practice the basics of rust and blockchain concepts.


Currently creates a simple blockchain and static blocks, then mines the block which involves solving the hash in regards to difficulty.
Once required difficulty is met the mine function adds it to blockchain.

Next steps:

* Add dynamic transactions
* Make a network of miners
